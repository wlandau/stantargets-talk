# Bayesian pipelines with {stantargets}

The [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) R package is an extension of `cmdstanr`, a lightweight interface to Stan, and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), a general-purpose pipeline tool for reproducible research and high-performance computing. [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) concisely expresses a Stan workflow as a [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) pipeline, and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) orchestrates the pipeline to efficiently bring the results up to date with the underlying code and data. By simplifying pipeline creation, [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) reduces the practical burden of developing and maintaining reproducible analysis workflows for Bayesian statistics. This talk overviews [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) and demonstrates them using a Bayesian longitudinal linear model.
