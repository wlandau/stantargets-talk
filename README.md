# Bayesian pipelines with stantargets

The [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) R package is an extension of [CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/), a lightweight interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), a general-purpose pipeline tool for reproducible research and high-performance computing. In [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/), a complicated Stan workflow becomes a concise [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) pipeline, and [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) orchestrates the pipeline to efficiently bring the results up to date with the underlying code and data. By simplifying pipeline creation, [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) reduces the practical burden of developing and maintaining reproducible analysis workflows for Bayesian statistics. This talk introduces [`stantargets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/) and demonstrates it using a Bayesian longitudinal linear model.
